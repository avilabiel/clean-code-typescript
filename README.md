# clean-code-typescript

This repository aims to store some clean code techniques to help anyone that wants to excel their skills on Clean Code.

## Techniques

### Meaningful variables

Variables names should be meaningful and express clearly what they mean.

### Tiny functions

Keep one identation level on your functions. If there are more levels, let's create other functions.

### Functions as verbs

Functions should be verbs.

### Classes as nouns

Classes should be nouns.

### Named booleans

When the condition is hard to understand, let's name it!

### Simple objects

Keep one idendation level on your objects! If there are more, let's create other objects.

### Descruturing Params

Destruct params to not enforce params positions.
